A library to compute Jacobi polynomials. Version 0.9.2 (2006-11-22)

This library provides functions that can compute Jacobi Polynomials.
It also provides functions to deal with Gauss-Jacobi quadratures. It 
can calculate the nodes and weights. It can also compute the derivative
matrix and interpolation matrix. It is based on code from the C 
library libjacobi. The only difference is that any dependency on 
the GNU Scientific library has been removed.
